Hello!
This is my first competition on kaggle ,
I got 0.76555 from 1 at the first submission ,I want to improve it . 
This is  the code of it : 
In this code at first I import train CSV file and do preprocessing on it ,then I use Random forest to learn this dataset , after that I Import test  CSV file and do preprocessing on it , then I predict with Random forest model.
For missing values I use Random forest. In other words I get the whole dataset except rows that contain missing values and the model learns with them. After that I get the whole dataset except columns that contain missing values so the model predicts it.
